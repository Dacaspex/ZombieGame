## About

## Help

**goal:** <br>
The goal of the game is simple: Survive as long as possible without dying. Therefore you need to kill all the zombies of a wave to go to the next wave and get a better highscore.

**What you basicly should do** <br>
As soon as the wave number has disappeard, a horde of zombies will storm at you. When you've slaughtered all zombies, a new wave will spawn. <br>
When you are out of ammo, the game will automaticly reload your gun (if you have bullets left of course). You can check your gun and utility info as well as your health and inventory in the lower left corner of the screen. You can see your money as well listed below the gun info. <br>
Everytime when you kill a zombie, you'll receive a certain amount of money. With this money, you can buy more ammo or better guns in the shop, which you can open by hitting "space". In the shop you can also reload your guns with new ammunition.
