## About

The game is simply about reaching the end. Stay alive as long as possible and hold off the shadows. How long can you survive?

## Help

**Goal:** <br>
The goal of the game is simple: Survive as long as possible without dying. Therefore you need to kill all the shadows of a wave to go to the next wave.

**What you basicly should do** <br>
As soon as the wave number has disappeard, a horde of shadows will storm at you. When you've killed all shadows, a new wave will spawn. <br>
When you are out of spirit flames, the game will automaticaly reload. You can check your spirit flames left info as well as your health in the lower left corner of the screen. <br>
