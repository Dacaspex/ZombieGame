Your soul has crossed the river Stix-You are slowly rotting away-Zombies ate your brains-Good night, sleep tight, dont let the dead bite-This is the way the world ends; not with a bang or a whimper, but with zombies breaking down the back door-You have been killed by a zombie-Better luck next time-You failed holding them off-Why? Just why?-That didn't go as planned
